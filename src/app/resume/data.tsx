              Unsupervised learning of the relationship between cancer samples
              from chromosome specific distances of copy number distributions
            </p>

            <p>
              As a mutation called the somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) has
              been shown to highly correlate with oncogenesis, we investigated
              how SCNA profiles of cancer samples can be utilised to identify
              the subtype of cancers using a distance called the Wasserstein
              distance. The distance is used primarily to measure the
              dissimilarity of two different probability distributions, but it
              can be generalised to include any arbitrary finite distributions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We sourced the dataset from a Python library called CNSistent,
              calculated the distances with varying combination of
              hyper-parameters, visualised using UMAP and MDS, and clustered
              with HDBSCAN, K-Means, and GMM. The resulting distance matrix is
              also used to create an outlier detection method.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results show that Wasserstein distance can capture these
              differences. Although the performance is not that different with
              the benchmark, i.e. when the SCNA profile is used directly as the
              input feature vector for UMAP and MDS, the resulting method
              creates a more interpretable approach to analyse the differences
              between these profiles.

            <p>
              Computing fluid dynamics is a highly complex problem. The research
              group was planning to develop a measuring device for heat capacity
              of windows that entails a specific air circulation in an enclosed
              system. We extended the lid-driven cavity problem to three
              dimensional and developed an application package that can simulate
              the airflow with various boundary cases.
